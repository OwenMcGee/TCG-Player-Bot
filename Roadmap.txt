-ignore prices too high to be cheaper even with $0 shipping
-ignore art cards
-ignore/check collector's editions to make sure they are legal
-search for text referring to "tournament" and "legal"
-check for exact title text
-if you look at an entire page of printings and see no matches for the card you're searching for, stop and don't look at any later pages


Information it needs:
-cost of all cards at all relevant printings per seller
-card foil status, condition
-shipping costs at each seller
-potential shipping discounts/waivers




Optional/stretch goals:
1. select printing
2. printing whitelists & blacklists
5. select thresholds for multiple printings
4. handle tokens
5. select "any printing with X art"
6. toggle to allow cards that are / are not tournament legal
7. add UI
8. archidekt integration
9. document dependencies
